# Febin Modavancheri  

**Data Engineer  | Data Science Graduate | Data-Focused Software Engineer**  

MSc Data Science graduate from the University of Essex with 7+ years of experience working across data analysis, reporting, and application development. I work with real-world data to uncover patterns, build practical models, and create dashboards that support operational and business decision-making.

My background spans both data and software engineering, which allows me to approach problems end-to-end — from data ingestion and modelling to analysis, visualisation, and delivery.
